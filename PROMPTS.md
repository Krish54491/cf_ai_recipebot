<h1>All the prompts used</h1>
<li>Can you make a frontend in react with this code(then I pasted the current index.js)

<li>Access to fetch at 'http://127.0.0.1:8787/recipes' from origin 'http://localhost:5173' has been blocked by CORS policy: Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: It does not have HTTP ok status.
